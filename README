UsbMonitor

------------------------------------------------------------------

A simple tool to trace linux USB activity, using /dev/usbmon0.

By default it dumps all USB traffic.  Use options:

./usbmondump

 -b###  dump only bus ###
 -d###  dump only device ###
 -x###  exclude device ### from dump

Usbmon C++ API:

Simple example how to use it is usbmon-api.cpp and binary usbmonapi.

./usbmonapi does not have any parameters.  

If you don't have /dev/usbmon0 you probably need to load the driver:
% sudo modprobe usbmon

And you will likely have to adjust permissions too (unless you want to
run this program as root):
% sudo chown $USER /dev/usbmon0
